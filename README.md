# Student-Performance-Analysis
---
This project's main objective is to create two models, one for predicting a student's GPA (Grade Point Average) and another for classifying the student's ability to pass or not pass. Another objective for this project is to segment student performances into several clusters, in order to identify well and non-well performing students as well as characteristics of such student types.

The dataset could be found here: **https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OEsn8u3RKF1cnFfW3YwquYX7AUjVLcS8/view?usp=sharing**

note: in order to make it easier to extract, it is decided that the data would be placed inside github
